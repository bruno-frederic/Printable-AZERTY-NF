# Printable layout of standard (NF Z71-300) French AZERTY keyboard

Do you want to use the new standard French AZERTY keyboard layout [recently published (fr)](https://www.afnor.org/presse_avril2019/clavier-francais-norme-volontaire-pour-faciliter-ecriture/) ?

This project provides a base for a layout that you can print and stick to your current keyboard, to avoid buying a new one (let's save the planet ! ).

The layout is customizable via CSS (there are multiple CSS files in the `themes` folder).
